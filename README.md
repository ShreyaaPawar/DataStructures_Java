# DataStructures_Java

Why we need data structures?

Whenever we build real life project there is a huge chunk of data available. So, it's necessary to organize this data in a structurized manner so that it won't lead to any data loss. Also, it minimize the usage of resources like memory and space.

Types of data structures-

There are two types of data structures:
1)Linear data structure - datas are stored in a sequential manner. Each elements are connected to one another. eg: Arrays, Linked list.
2)Non linear data structure - datas are stored in a non sequential manner. Elements are connected to another through multiple paths. eg: Trees, Graphs.
