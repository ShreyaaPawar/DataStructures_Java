# DataStructures_Java

Why we need data structures?

Whenever we build a real-life project there is a huge chunk of data available. So, it's necessary to organize this data in a structured manner so that it won't lead to any data loss. Also, it minimizes the usage of resources like memory and space.

Types of data structures-

There are two types of data structures:
1)Linear data structure - datas are stored sequentially. Each elements is connected. eg: Arrays, Linked list.

2)Non-linear data structure - data are stored in a non-sequential manner. Elements are connected through multiple paths. eg: Trees, Graphs.
